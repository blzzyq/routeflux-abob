# RouteFlux

RouteFlux is an OpenWrt-native Xray subscription manager for routers and edge devices.

It helps you import proxy subscriptions, pick the right node, apply router traffic rules, and manage DNS without hand-editing Xray JSON. If RouteFlux saves you time, consider starring the repository and sharing it with other OpenWrt users.

## Overview



RouteFlux is built for people who want a practical proxy workflow on OpenWrt:

- Import a subscription URL, raw `vless://`, `vmess://`, `trojan://`, `socks5://`, `hysteria://`, or `hy2://` link, or a valid 3x-ui/Xray JSON config.
- Connect manually to a specific node or let RouteFlux pick the best node automatically.
- Manage everything from the CLI, LuCI web UI, or the local TUI.
- Keep router routing and DNS settings readable instead of burying them inside generated Xray config.

The current runtime target is OpenWrt and compatible forks such as ImmortalWrt. OpenWrt `22.03+` with `nftables` is the practical baseline.

## Features

- Fast import flow for subscriptions, share links, and supported 3x-ui/Xray JSON files.
- Support for VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Socks5, Hysteria, and Hysteria 2 proxy nodes.
- Safe runtime updates with `xray -test`, last-known-good backup, and controlled service reloads.
- Auto mode with health checks, live failover, anti-flap logic, and reboot-time runtime restore.
- Dedicated Server List view for optimized management of subscriptions and single servers.
- Only Selected Devices routing mode to direct only specified LAN hosts through the active proxy while leaving others direct.
- Parallel latency checks and auto best-node connection when selecting duplicate server names.
- Simple transparent routing rules for LAN hosts, destination targets, and split tunnelling policies.
- Dedicated DNS commands with a sensible default profile for everyday router use.
- Shared state across CLI, LuCI, and TUI, so you can switch interfaces without losing context.

## Quick Start

Install the latest stable release on your router:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/routeflux-install.sh "https://github.com/Alaxay8/routeflux/releases/latest/download/install.sh" && sh /tmp/routeflux-install.sh
```

Then import a subscription and connect:

```bash
routeflux add https://provider.example/subscription
routeflux list subscriptions
routeflux connect --auto --subscription sub-1234567890
```

After installation you can use:

- LuCI: `Services -> RouteFlux` opens `Subscriptions`
- CLI: over SSH with `routeflux ...`
- TUI: `routeflux tui`

## Web UI

RouteFlux includes a LuCI interface for everyday subscription management.

![RouteFlux LuCI Subscriptions](docs/images/luci-subscriptions-1.png)

The profile view shows subscription metadata, quick actions, auto exclusions, and the available node list.

![RouteFlux LuCI Subscription Profile](docs/images/luci-subscriptions-2.png)

The nodes table lets you compare latency, inspect transport details, connect manually, recheck routes, or exclude nodes from auto mode.

![RouteFlux LuCI Nodes Table](docs/images/luci-subscriptions-3.png)

The Routing page also includes a Keep Direct view for bypass selectors, where you can keep chosen domains or IPv4 targets on the direct path while bypass mode is active.

![RouteFlux LuCI Keep Direct](docs/images/keep-direrct.png)

For split routing workflows, the Excluded Devices view lets you keep selected LAN hosts outside the proxy path and manage them directly from LuCI.

![RouteFlux LuCI Excluded Devices](docs/images/exclude-devices.png)

RouteFlux also exposes Zapret fallback controls in LuCI, including automatic fallback behaviour, test mode, and the current transport state.

The Settings page includes appearance controls, so you can switch the RouteFlux LuCI theme without changing the rest of your OpenWrt setup.

## Installation

### Install from a GitHub release

Use the latest stable installer:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/routeflux-install.sh "https://github.com/Alaxay8/routeflux/releases/latest/download/install.sh" && sh /tmp/routeflux-install.sh
```

To update an existing router install in place without losing subscriptions, custom service aliases, or presets stored in `/etc/routeflux`:

```bash
ROUTEFLUX_TAG=v0.1.5
wget -O /tmp/routeflux-install.sh "https://github.com/Alaxay8/routeflux/releases/download/${ROUTEFLUX_TAG}/install.sh" && sh /tmp/routeflux-install.sh
```

If you need a pinned release:

```bash
ROUTEFLUX_TAG=v0.1.6
wget -O /tmp/routeflux-install.sh "https://github.com/Alaxay8/routeflux/releases/download/${ROUTEFLUX_TAG}/install.sh" && sh /tmp/routeflux-install.sh
```

The installer updates RouteFlux in place and preserves existing `/etc/routeflux` state files.
On OpenWrt it also installs the required runtime pieces automatically:

- base packages such as `ca-bundle`, `nftables`, `kmod-nft-tproxy`, and `dnsmasq-full`
- a download client (`curl` or `wget-ssl`) when the router image does not already provide one
- `unzip` when needed for the bundled Zapret package
- the bundled Xray runtime when the router does not already provide a usable Xray binary and service
- the bundled `zapret-openwrt` package when Zapret is not already installed

Use `sh /tmp/routeflux-install.sh --without-zapret` if you explicitly do not want the installer to provision Zapret.
The installer records which packages it had to add so the uninstaller can remove them later.
If the router image started with plain `dnsmasq`, the installer upgrades it to `dnsmasq-full` and records that `dnsmasq` must be restored during uninstall.

Current easy-install release assets are published for:

- `mipsel_24kc`
- `x86_64`
- `aarch64_cortex-a53`

To remove RouteFlux, the bundled Xray runtime, bundled Zapret, and installer-managed packages:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/routeflux-uninstall.sh "https://github.com/Alaxay8/routeflux/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh" && sh /tmp/routeflux-uninstall.sh
```

### Build from source

Requirements:

- Go `1.26` or later
- OpenWrt or ImmortalWrt with `nftables`

Build the local binary:

```bash
make build
```

Cross-build for OpenWrt:

```bash
make build-openwrt
make build-openwrt-x86_64
make build-openwrt-aarch64_cortex-a53
```

Create release artifacts:

```bash
make package-release
```

For a manual router install, copy the generated tarball to the router and extract it at `/`:

```bash
VERSION="$(git describe --tags --always --dirty | sed 's/^v//')"
ARCH="${ARCH:-aarch64_cortex-a53}"
scp -O "./dist/routeflux_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" root@router:/tmp/
ssh root@router "tar -xzf /tmp/routeflux_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz -C / && rm -f /tmp/luci-indexcache && rm -rf /tmp/luci-modulecache && /etc/init.d/rpcd reload && /etc/init.d/uhttpd reload"
```

## Usage

### Everyday flow

```bash
routeflux add https://provider.example/subscription
routeflux list subscriptions
routeflux list nodes --subscription sub-1234567890
routeflux connect --subscription sub-1234567890 --node abcdef123456
routeflux status
routeflux disconnect
```

### Auto mode

```bash
routeflux connect --auto --subscription sub-1234567890
routeflux daemon
```

Use `routeflux daemon --once` when you want a single refresh and health scan without running a long-lived service.

On OpenWrt, enable the service when you want auto refresh, failover monitoring, and reboot-time restore:

```bash
/etc/init.d/routeflux enable
/etc/init.d/routeflux start
```

### LuCI pages

- `Subscriptions`: import providers, inspect profiles, and connect.
- `Routing`: the simplified everyday flow for `Off`, `Bypass`, direct domains, direct IPv4 selectors, and the DNS preset choice.
- `DNS`: full DNS control for `system`, `remote`, `split`, and `disabled`.
- `Zapret`: fallback domains only. Use fully qualified domains such as `youtube.com` or `googlevideo.com`.
- `services` in the CLI remain available as advanced reusable aliases for firewall targets.

### DNS and firewall helpers

On OpenWrt, `routeflux dns set default` applies the Recommended DNS preset. It is a preset, not a fifth DNS mode. `routeflux dns set mode remote|split` and the other real DNS modes still affect the router and LAN DNS path while a node is connected. RouteFlux points `dnsmasq` at a local Xray DNS runtime, keeps `.lan` style names local in split mode, and returns to system DNS on disconnect.

```bash
routeflux dns get
routeflux dns set default
routeflux dns explain

routeflux firewall get
routeflux firewall set hosts 192.168.1.150
routeflux firewall set targets youtube instagram 1.1.1.1
routeflux firewall set split --proxy youtube --bypass gosuslugi.ru --exclude-host 192.168.1.50
routeflux services set openai openai.com chatgpt.com oaistatic.com
routeflux services list
routeflux zapret get
routeflux zapret set selectors youtube.com googlevideo.com
routeflux firewall explain
```

### Other useful commands

```bash
routeflux refresh --all
routeflux move sub-1234567890 up
routeflux restart
routeflux remove sub-1234567890
routeflux diagnostics
routeflux logs
routeflux settings get
routeflux services list
routeflux version
routeflux tui
```

## Examples

Import a raw share link:

```bash
routeflux add 'vless://uuid@example.com:443?...#Example'
```

Import a valid 3x-ui or Xray JSON config:

```bash
routeflux add < ./client-config.json
```

Route one LAN device through the active RouteFlux connection:

```bash
routeflux firewall set hosts 192.168.1.150
routeflux connect --subscription sub-1234567890 --node 90c42d5dd302
```

Route your whole private LAN through RouteFlux:

```bash
routeflux firewall set hosts all
routeflux connect --subscription sub-1234567890 --node 90c42d5dd302
```

Use encrypted DNS for external domains while keeping local names on the router:

```bash
routeflux dns set default
```

Create a custom target alias once and reuse it in firewall targets:

```bash
routeflux services set openai openai.com chatgpt.com oaistatic.com
routeflux firewall set targets openai youtube
```

Use split tunnelling to keep selected banking or government sites direct while proxying specific services and excluding one LAN device:

```bash
routeflux firewall set split --proxy youtube openai --bypass gosuslugi.ru sberbank.ru --exclude-host 192.168.1.50
routeflux connect --subscription sub-1234567890 --node 90c42d5dd302
```

## Configuration

By default, RouteFlux stores state under `/etc/routeflux` on OpenWrt. For local development it uses `./.routeflux`.

Useful environment variables:

- `ROUTEFLUX_ROOT`: override the state directory
- `ROUTEFLUX_XRAY_CONFIG`: override the generated Xray config path
- `ROUTEFLUX_XRAY_SERVICE`: override the Xray service control script
- `ROUTEFLUX_XRAY_BINARY`: override the Xray binary used for validation
- `ROUTEFLUX_FIREWALL_RULES`: override the generated nftables rules file path

Main persisted files:

- `/etc/routeflux/subscriptions.json`
- `/etc/routeflux/settings.json`
- `/etc/routeflux/state.json`

For guided explanations, prefer the built-in help:

- `routeflux dns explain`
- `routeflux firewall explain`
- `routeflux settings --help`

## DNS Modes

CLI help keeps the common path short. This section is the detailed DNS reference.

If you do not want to think about DNS details, use this:

```bash
routeflux dns set default
```

It is the best everyday option for most users: local names stay local, public DNS is encrypted.

- `system`: leave DNS as it is
Example: your router DNS already works fine and you do not want RouteFlux to change it.

```bash
routeflux dns set mode system
```

- `remote`: send every DNS request to the DNS servers you choose
Example: you want all DNS to go through Cloudflare or Google DNS.

```bash
routeflux dns set mode remote
routeflux dns set transport doh
routeflux dns set servers "1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"
```

- `split`: keep local names on the router, send internet domains to your chosen DNS
Example: `router.lan` stays local, `google.com` goes to encrypted DNS.

```bash
routeflux dns set default
```

- `disabled`: do not write RouteFlux DNS settings into Xray config
Example: useful only for custom setups where DNS is managed somewhere else.

```bash
routeflux dns set mode disabled
```

DNS transports:

- `plain`: normal DNS, no encryption
- `doh`: encrypted DNS over HTTPS

## Firewall Modes

CLI help keeps the common path short. This section is the detailed firewall reference.

- `disabled`: do not redirect router traffic through RouteFlux
Example: RouteFlux is installed, but no device is forced through the proxy.

```bash
routeflux firewall disable
```

What still works when firewall is disabled:

- you can add, refresh, remove, and inspect subscriptions
- you can connect to a node manually or in auto mode
- RouteFlux still generates and applies the Xray config for the selected node
- DNS settings still work
- CLI, LuCI, TUI, daemon, health checks, and failover still work

What does not happen when firewall is disabled:

- RouteFlux does not add nftables redirect rules
- router traffic is not sent through the proxy automatically
- LAN devices do not use the selected node until you enable `hosts`, `targets`, or `split`
- transparent proxy mode is not enabled for intercepted traffic

In simple words: RouteFlux still manages subscriptions and the active Xray runtime, but it does not capture traffic from the router or your LAN by itself.

- `targets`: send traffic through RouteFlux only when the destination matches selected services, domains, or IPv4 targets
Example: only traffic to specific services should go through the proxy.

```bash
routeflux firewall set targets youtube instagram 1.1.1.1
```

Target selectors:

- service preset: `discord`, `facetime`, `gemini`, `gemini-mobile`, `instagram`, `netflix`, `notebooklm`, `notebooklm-mobile`, `telegram`, `twitter`, `whatsapp`, `youtube`
- custom service alias: `openai`
- domain: `youtube.com`
- IPv4 address: `1.1.1.1`
- subnet: `8.8.8.0/24`
- range: `203.0.113.10-203.0.113.20`

Notes for domain targets:

- Create your own aliases with `routeflux services set <name> <domain-or-ip...>`, then use that alias in `routeflux firewall set targets ...`.
- Custom aliases can contain only domains, IPv4 addresses, CIDRs, and IPv4 ranges.
- Built-in preset names are reserved and stay read-only.
- RouteFlux treats `youtube.com` as the domain and its subdomains.
- Popular presets like `youtube`, `instagram`, `discord`, `twitter`, `netflix`, `whatsapp`, `gemini`, `gemini-mobile`, `notebooklm`, and `notebooklm-mobile` expand to the domain families they need.
- Popular root domains like `youtube.com`, `instagram.com`, `netflix.com`, `x.com`, `gemini.google.com`, and `notebooklm.google.com` still auto-expand to the domain families they need.
- Use `gemini-mobile` and `notebooklm-mobile` for the Android or iOS apps when the web presets are too narrow.
- The mobile Google AI presets may include a small set of IPv4 targets in addition to domains because some app traffic does not expose a usable hostname.
- `gemini`, `gemini-mobile`, `notebooklm`, `notebooklm-mobile`, `telegram`, `facetime`, `twitter`, and `netflix` are best-effort presets because those apps may use direct IPs or broader shared vendor infrastructure.
- `telegram` includes the main Telegram web domains plus the official IPv4 ranges commonly used by MTProto clients.
- The mobile Google AI presets are intentionally broader and may also catch shared Google infrastructure. If they are still not enough for your device, add the missing Google domains as a custom alias and route that alias instead.
- Domain targets require `dnsmasq` with `nftset` support, which usually means `dnsmasq-full` on OpenWrt.
- Domain targets depend on router-visible DNS answers. If clients use their own DoH or DoT directly, target IP sets may stay empty.
- On shared CDNs, RouteFlux now falls back to direct routing for non-matching transparent traffic instead of sending every matched IP through the selected node.
- `split`: use separate proxy, direct, and excluded-device tables
Example: proxy streaming or work services, keep banking sites direct, and leave one TV or laptop untouched.

```bash
routeflux firewall set split --proxy youtube openai --bypass gosuslugi.ru sberbank.ru --exclude-host 192.168.1.50
```

Split selectors:

- service preset: `discord`, `facetime`, `gemini`, `gemini-mobile`, `instagram`, `netflix`, `notebooklm`, `notebooklm-mobile`, `telegram`, `twitter`, `whatsapp`, `youtube`
- custom service alias: `openai`
- domain: `gosuslugi.ru`
- IPv4 address: `1.1.1.1`
- subnet: `8.8.8.0/24`
- range: `203.0.113.10-203.0.113.20`
- excluded device selector: `192.168.1.50`, `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.20`, or `all`

Notes for split tunnelling:

- Split uses the same selector parsing and alias expansion as `targets`.
- `Keep Direct` wins over `Route Through RouteFlux` when both match the same destination.
- Unmatched split traffic stays direct by default in LuCI and the main CLI workflow.
- Domain-based split rules require `dnsmasq` with `nftset` support when they must populate nftables destination sets on OpenWrt.
- `routeflux firewall set anti-target ...` remains available as a legacy alias for `split` with bypass-only selectors and proxy fallback.
- `block-quic` controls proxied QUIC handling. Enable it only when you intentionally want RouteFlux to block proxied QUIC and force clients to retry over TCP.
- `hosts`: send all traffic from selected LAN devices through RouteFlux
Example: route one phone, TV, or laptop through the proxy.

```bash
routeflux firewall set hosts 192.168.1.150
```

Host selectors:

- one device: `192.168.1.150`
- subnet: `192.168.1.0/24`
- range: `192.168.1.150-192.168.1.159`
- whole private LAN: `all`

Examples:

```bash
routeflux firewall set hosts 192.168.1.0/24
routeflux firewall set hosts 192.168.1.150-192.168.1.159
routeflux firewall set hosts all
```

Other firewall options:

- `block-quic`: block proxied QUIC/UDP traffic and force TCP fallback when needed
- `port`: changes the transparent redirect port
